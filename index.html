                            <h3> Variability of wheat phenology from Sentinel-1 and-2 time series: a case study for
                                Brandenburg, Germany </h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <p> Crop phenology plays a vital role in regulating agricultural practices and managing
                                natural resources. Accurate estimation of different phenological stages of crops can
                                help in timely irrigation, yield prediction and fertilization. Remote sensing has proven
                                to be a viable technique to monitor phenology over traditional field measurements. High
                                spatial and temporal resolution of two European satellites, Sentinel-1 and -2 provide a
                                unique opportunity to monitor phenology of crops. However, accurate estimation of
                                crop-specific phenology is lacking at a large scale. This study estimated wheat
                                phenology from Sentinel-1 and -2 time series for Brandenburg state of Germany for 2017
                                to 2021 using parcel information from Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data and
                                ground truth information from the German Meteorological Station (DWD). The spatial and
                                temporal variability of wheat phenology were explained with temperature and
                                precipitation data. Time series of three SAR parameters from Sentienl-1 (VV, VH and
                                VH/VV (CR)) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Sentinel-2 were generated for wheat
                                fields in Google Earth Engine. LOESS and Double Logistics (DL) methods were tested to
                                fit the data to reduce noise. As LOESS performed better in terms of representation of
                                the temporal trajectory of wheat, LOESS was retained and used for subsequent analysis.
                                Both CR and EVI were proven to be sensitive to wheat growing stages. Breakpoints and
                                threshold methods were tested on LOESS fitted CR and EVI to match the DWD reported
                                in-situ phenology phases. Third breakpoint from CR had median values of 0 to 3 days
                                (different depending on the year) with milk ripeness phase, while the fourth breakpoint
                                had median values of 1 to 5 days with the harvest phase. Peak of season (POP) estimated
                                from EVI was correlated with the ears emerge phase with a median difference of 0 to 10
                                days. In general, the estimated dates were earlier than the field dates. For most cases,
                                median values were less than the revisit period of both the sensors signifying the
                                agreement between the in-situ and remote sensing estimates. However, due to outlier
                                profiles, the RMSE values were between eight to twelve days. Coefficient of
                                determination (R²) between mean estimated phenology and DWD reported phenology were 0.24
                                for ears emerge, 0.18 for milk ripeness, and 0.24 for harvest. It is noted that the low
                                R² values do not coincide with the achieved RMSE and median values. For most cases, a
                                south north spatial pattern was noticed where the south had earlier retrievals of phases
                                than the north. A similar gradient was noticed in temperature, where the southern part
                                experienced higher temperature than the northern counterpart. Interannual variability
                                was evident from the findings where warmer temperatures led to earlier retrievals (R²
                                0.24 for ears emerge, 0.02 for milk ripeness and 0.25 for harvest). Weaker positive
                                correlations were found between precipitation and estimated stages of crops. This study
                                demonstrates that Sentinel-1 and -2 have a high potential to monitor crop-specific
                                phenology of wheat for a large area which can be used in crop productivity monitoring.
                                The information can help in risk damage assessment in agricultural systems.

                            <p>
                                In August 24, 2017, a massive outbreak took place in the Rakhine state of Myanmar which
                                triggered a huge refugee infux to the Teknaf Peninsula, Bangladesh. To settle the
                                refugees, makeshift camps were built in large numbers destroying huge amount of forest
                                areas near the existing Kutupalong and Nayapara camps. Refugees have been encroaching
                                the nearby forest covers to collect fuelwood and other purposes. These forest
                                destructions have put the wildlife and biodiversity of the system in a substantial
                                pressure as well as altering the land surface temperature (LST). This paper has examined
                                the extent of vegetation change and the changes of LST from 2017 to 2019 throughout
                                Kutupalong and Balukhali camp and adjacent areas using Landsat 8 images. Random forest
                                algorithm and Plank equation were applied on images to identify vegetation change and
                                LST, respectively. The overall and kappa accuracies for the maps of 2017 are 96% and
                                92%, respectively, while it stands at 94% and 88% for the 2019 image. Results derived
                                from the analysis suggest that an estimated 1876 hectares of forested lands have been
                                decreased in the study area. LST of the study area increased spatially throughout the
                                whole region with a maximum value of 34 °C which is signifcantly higher than the
                                pre-infux period. If this trend of forest-clearing activities continues, the place will
                                become barren land soon and the LST will also increase. All these factors will
                                ultimately trigger the climate change impacts and biodiversity loss of the area.

                            <p> Encroachment of woody plants into grasslands occurs in drylands worldwide and often
                                negatively impacts key ecosystem services such as grass production and erosion control.
                                To control or reverse the process, land managers use different strategies, such as
                                herbicide applications. However, the efficacy of treatments across space and through
                                time is typically unclear, because post-treatment vegetation changes are not monitored
                                in a spatially and temporally explicit manner. To address this issue, we tested the
                                utility of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and image differencing
                                for mapping fractional cover changes of photosynthetic vegetation (woody plants),
                                non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil in response to herbicide treatment. Our case
                                study area included 20 paired control/treatment plots of honey mesquite (Prosopis
                                glandulosa) encroached rangeland on the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New
                                Mexico, USA. Our input data included Sentinel-2 satellite imagery acquired over the
                                study area before and after treatment in August/September 2021; ii) field spectral
                                reflectance data of green and senescing mesquite, other plants, and soil collected using
                                an ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res Spectroradiometer; and iii) fractional cover data estimated
                                along three transects per plots. We applied MESMA using Sentinel data spectral
                                endmembers selected using three different endmember selection strategies. We assessed
                                the accuracy of the fractional cover maps using the transect data. Our results suggest
                                that MESMA and image differencing may provide a timely, cost-effective, and accurate
                                remote sensing approach for monitoring the effectiveness of herbicide treatments on
                                mesquite-encroached rangelands.

                                The Colon Province on the Caribbean side of central Panama has experienced remarkable
                                land cover changes in recent decades, in part due to the expansion of a large open-pit
                                copper mine, Cobre Panamá. There is significant concern among infectious disease experts
                                in the country that these land cover changes are modifying the risk of mosquito-borne
                                diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. To better understand the relationships between
                                land cover and disease risk, these experts need multi-temporal land cover maps that can
                                be integrated in spatially explicit disease risk models. Our main objectives were to
                                generate these maps and assess spatio-temporal changes in landscape composition and
                                configuration in the Cobre Panamá mine region. To meet these objectives, we 1) applied
                                three classifiers (convolutional neural networks, random forest, and support vector
                                machine) to cloud-free Sentinel 2 image composites (optical data), Sentinel 1 image
                                composites (radar data), and fused Sentinel 1 and 2 image composites (optical-radar)
                                from the year 2021; 2) used the most accurate classifier / image combination to map land
                                cover for two additional years (2015 and 2018); 3) created change maps and statistics
                                for the 2015-2018, 2018-2021, and 2015-2021 time periods using post-classification
                                comparison and intensity analysis; and 4) quantified changes in landscape configuration
                                during the same time periods using FRAGSTATS and MSPA. In this paper presentation, we
                                will describe in more detail the methodological approach as well as the results.

                                Created and refined endmembers and MESMA processing using Visualization and Image
                                Processing for Environmental Research (VIPER) Tools 2.1, an open-source extension to
                                ENVI 5.6. Our spectral library contains 778 spectra from the fieldwork and Converse et
                                al. (2021). We used the whole spectral library and ran MESMA using 2-3-4 endmember
                                models. We retained the endmembers which contributed at least 0.01% of the total
                                fraction cover. In total 178 spectra were retained and we named the library as ‘reduced
                                library’. We applied MESMA on Sentinel data at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution and with
                                reduced spectral library, EMC, IES, and InCOB, three different endmember selection
                                strategies (Converse et al 2021). The resultant spectra from EMC, IES, InCOB, and
                                ‘reduced spectral library’ are 8, 37, 41, and 178 respectively and 10-m resolution
                                imagery produced better results than 20-m for both pre and post treatment. EMC produced
                                40% of unclassified pixels for both 10 and 20m spatial resolution imagery, while IES,
                                InCOB and ‘reduced spectral library had less than 2% unclassified pixels. Hence, we did
                                not consider EMC for the final output. IES and InCOB picked more photosynthetic
                                vegetation than the reduced spectral library. PV fractional cover percentages were
                                reduced significantly from pre to post treatment phase. NPV fraction is also reduced
                                from pre to post treatment phase. It can be argued that a lot of the non-photosynthetic
                                vegetation was confused with the soil class, especially in the post-treatment imagery.
                                Agreement between the MESMA fraction and transact varies between the classes with NPV
                                showing highest agreement and soil showing lowest agreement.

                                Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are calculated using specific equations, based on
                                reflectance in Near Infrared, Red, and Blue regions. These indices are averaged across
                                different areas and visualized over time, revealing potential spatial variations.
                                Temporal profiles of these indices are then created, with outliers smoothed using LOESS,
                                to compare with field phenophases. Lastly, mean temperature and precipitation data over
                                three months are correlated with these phenophases, aiding in understanding the
                                influence of weather on vegetation growth.

                                sophisticated mobile application that will come in handy during emergency situations.
                                This application minimize the communication gap between the people and the emergency
                                services such as Ambulance, Fire Service etc. Finding the global position of the user
                                and using that to calculate the nearest emergency services available for the user is the
                                main goal of the application.Furthermore, “Quick SMS” service is being integrated so
                                that the user can send text messages to certain phone numbers, automatically stating
                                his/her location along with global position.
